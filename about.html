        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
          For decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world
          by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were
          pioneers in the transition of the world from vacuum tubes to
          transistors and then to integrated circuits (ICs) – and we’ve been
          advancing IC technology and the ability to reliably produce ICs in
          high volumes for decades. Each generation of innovation builds upon
          the last to make technology smaller, more efficient, more reliable and
          more affordable – making it possible for semiconductors to go into
          electronics everywhere. We think of this as Engineering Progress. It’s
          what we do and have been doing for decades:

          <p>
            Our broad portfolio of ~80,000 products helps our customers
            efficiently manage power, accurately sense and transmit data, and
            provide the core control or processing in their electronic systems.
            We partner with our customers to understand their toughest
            challenges, then apply our technology and system expertise and work
            persistently to overcome barriers and problem-solve.
